Pinpoint is a membership application management service geared towards helping university clubs and hackathons decide on the best applicants out of their pool of candidates.

See the project outline and minimum viable product in our [wiki](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/pinpoint/wiki/Project-Outline).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `client` is the JavaScript client for the user-facing Pinpoint API.
- `core` is the primary Pinpoint gRPC-based service, and manages application logic and the database.
- `frontend` is the Pinpoint web application.
- `gateway` is an HTTP server that exposes Pinpoint functionality via a RESTful API.
- `grpc` is a Golang package for Pinpoint Core's gRPC service, generated from protobuf definitions.
- `protobuf` contains protobuf definitions for Pinpoint Core's gRPC service.
- `utils` is a Golang package that contains utility functions shared by `core` and `gateway`.

## Development

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.11+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8.12+
- [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) v3.6+ and the [Golang plugin](https://github.com/golang/protobuf#installation)
- [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To fetch the codebase, use `go get`:

```bash
$> go get github.com/ubclaunchpad/pinpoint
```

### Installing Dependencies

You will need [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep#installation) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

```bash
$> make deps
```

### Building

To build the Golang components, run the following commands:

```sh
$> make core
$> make gateway
```

### Spinning up Services Locally

Run the following commands in two separate shell sessions:

```
$> ./bin/pinpoint-core run --dev
$> ./bin/pinpoint-gateway run --dev
```

### Updating the Golang gRPC API

`gateway` and `core` uses the Golang API within the `grpc` directory to communicate. If you make changes to the protobuf definitions in the `protobuf` directories, you will need to update this API:

```bash
$> make proto
```

You will need [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) v3.6+ and the [Golang plugin](https://github.com/golang/protobuf#installation) installed.
